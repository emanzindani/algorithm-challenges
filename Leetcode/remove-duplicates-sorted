#Python solution:
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # left pointer to start at one because first element is always unique
        left = 1
        # i iterates through the nums, starting from index 1 element two so we can compare to one before
        for i in range(1,len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != nums[i-1]:
                nums[left] = nums[i]
                left += 1
        return left
