Question: How many times will 'getValue(â€¦)' execute in the following cases, and what will be the result of each?

  (1) getValue("foo", 0);
  (2) getValue("bar", 2);
  (3) getValue("baz", 0);
  (4) getValue("fubar", 1);

  To determine how many times 'getValue(...)' will execute in each case and what the result will be, let's go through each scenario step by step:

(1) getValue("foo", 0);

In this case, the input is "foo" and the number of retries is 0. The method 'getValue(...)' will directly try to retrieve the value associated with "foo" from the map. Since "foo" is present in the map with a value of 1, the method will return 1. The method is called only once, and the result is 1.

(2) getValue("bar", 2);

In this case, the input is "bar" and the number of retries is 2. The method 'getValue(...)' will try to retrieve the value associated with "bar" from the map. "bar" is present in the map with a value of 3, so the method will return 3. The method is called only once, and the result is 3.

(3) getValue("baz", 0);

In this case, the input is "baz" and the number of retries is 0. The method 'getValue(...)' will try to retrieve the value associated with "baz" from the map. However, "baz" is not present in the map, so it will throw an exception (specifically, a NullPointerException). Since no catch block is provided in the method, this exception will propagate back to the caller. The method is called only once, and it throws an exception.

(4) getValue("fubar", 1);

In this case, the input is "fubar" and the number of retries is 1. The method 'getValue(...)' will try to retrieve the value associated with "fubar" from the map. "fubar" is not present in the map, so it will throw an exception (specifically, a NullPointerException). Since the catch block catches the exception and the number of retries (numRetries) is less than 3, it will recursively call 'getValue(...)' with an incremented numRetries value (numRetries + 1 = 2).

The recursion will repeat, and the method will be called again:

getValue("fubar", 2);

Now, with numRetries as 2, it will try to retrieve the value associated with "fubar" from the map, but as before, "fubar" is not present in the map, so it throws an exception. Since the number of retries is still less than 3, it will call the method again:

getValue("fubar", 3);

Now, with numRetries as 3, it will try to retrieve the value associated with "fubar" from the map, but as before, "fubar" is not present in the map, so it throws an exception. This time, the number of retries is equal to 3, so the catch block will throw the exception, and it will not call the method again.

The total number of times the method is called in this case is 4 (including the initial call and three recursive calls). The method throws an exception in the end.

To summarize:

(1) getValue("foo", 0): Called once, returns 1.
(2) getValue("bar", 2): Called once, returns 3.
(3) getValue("baz", 0): Called once, throws an exception.
(4) getValue("fubar", 1): Called four times (recursively), throws an exception.
