# Given the pointer to the head node of a linked list and an integer to insert at a certain position, create a new node with the given integer as its  attribute, insert this node at the desired position and return the head node.

# A position of 0 indicates head, a position of 1 indicates one node away from the head and so on. The head pointer given may be null meaning that the initial list is empty.
